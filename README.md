<h3>Project Description:</h3>

We want to look across multiple independent variables, like number of credit cards and interest rate, to determine whether or not we can predict someone's credit score. We'll leverage a supervised learning model to help us make those predictions. 

<h3>Questions to Answer:</h3>
  <li>Using a trained model, can we predict someone's credit score?</li>

<h3>Data Components:</h3>
  <li>Number of credit cards</li>
  <li>Number of delayed payments</li>
  <li>Interest rate</li>
  <li>Monthly income</li>
  <li>Loan types</li>
